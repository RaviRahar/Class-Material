**Notes:**  
- ~ means that resource is not available
- Books too large to open online will be downloaded
- Google Docs is used to display pdfs/ppts/docs/etc. Clone repository and download if not comfortable with google.

## Contribution
- Add lecture if not available in that classes' folder
- Follow naming scheme: L1.pdf - Lecture 1, Lab1.pdf - Lab 1
- Do not change readmes(can change link in case of a book but not its structure), links will get activated as soon as you add the file with correct naming scheme.
